# Ecko: A Keyword Spotting Accelerator for Caravel SoC

Ecko is an open-source hardware accelerator designed specifically for efficient and accurate Keyword Spotting (KWS) on edge devices. Leveraging the power of the "Hello Edge" CNN model and optimized through the Gemmini platform, Ecko seamlessly integrates with the Caravel System-on-Chip to provide real-time speech recognition capabilities.
